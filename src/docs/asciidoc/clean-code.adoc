== Why Does Clean Code Matter?
* The compiler doesn't care about clean code, *people* do
* Code is read and updated *many* more times than it's written
* Clean code is easier to *read*, easier to *reason about*, and easier to *test*

== What Makes Code 'clean' ?

=== Encapsulation
* API hides implementation details
* Follows the Interface Segregation principle (one role)

image:alarm_ringing-512.png[width=30]

* Watch out for
** big APIs (many public methods)
** internal data structures visible/modifiable

=== Encapsulation :(
[source,java]
-----
public class AllTheData {
  public Map getCache() {...}
  public Map setCache() {...}
  public List getSqlQueries() {...}
  public boolean isCacheInitialised() {...}
  public boolean setCacheInitialised(boolean b) {...}
}
-----
* Implementation details exposed (can't be changed easily)
* No operations on the data (all changes driven by client code)
* More than one role

=== Encapsulation :)
[source,java]
-----
public class EncapsulatedCache<T> {
  public T get(String key) throws CacheMissException {...}
  public void put(String key, T value) {...}
  public boolean isInitialised() {...}
}
-----
* Hides the implementation (could be a Map, could be a database table)
* API focused on doing one job

=== Cohesion (method and class scope)
* Low ‘concept-count’ – Single Responsibility principle

image:alarm_ringing-512.png[width=30]

* Watch out for
** Generic/bland class & method names
** Awkward class & method names
** Many arguments to a function
** Many fields
** Long classes/methods

=== Cohesion :(
[source,java]
-----
public class DataAndSettingsManagerUtils {
  private Map data = new HashMap();
  private Map settings = new HashMap();
  private int updateCount =0;
  private static final String SEP="-"
  ...

  public void updateData(...) {...}
  public void loadSettings() {...}
  public void loadInitialData() {...}
  public static Exception translateException(Exception e) {...}
  ...
  public static String prettyPrint(Map data) {...}
}
-----
* Not a meaningful class name (warning sign)
* Multiple roles

=== Cohesion :)
[source,java]
-----
public class HealthStatus {
    private final List substatuses;
    public HealthStatus(HealthStatus ... substatuses) {...}
    public Level getLevel() {...}
    public String getReason() {...}
    public String relatingTo() {...}
}
-----
* Does one thing
* Small API


=== Coupling
* Law of Demeter
* Dependency Inversion principle
** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
** Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.


image:alarm_ringing-512.png[width=30]

* Watch out for
** Circular dependencies
** Many dependencies
** Inheritance for reusability (coupling between parent & children)

=== Coupling :(
[source,java]
-----
public class GateController extends AbstractParentController {
  private PostgresDatabase db;
  private FileBasedConfigurationService config;
  private HelperService helper;
  private FileSystemScanner scanner;
  private IRSensorArray sensors;
  ...
}
-----
* Many dependencies
** a change in any dependency or the parent class is a potential change to the ```GateController```

=== Coupling :(
[source,java]
-----
controller.getScheduler().start(operation, manager.getConfiguration().lookup("TIMEOUT"))
-----
* Law of Demeter
** aka "Don't talk to strangers"
** aka train-wrecks
* Client code is coupled to changes in the ```controller```, ```scheduler```, ```manager``` and ```configuration```
* Very prone to ```NullPointerException```s


=== Coupling :)
[source,java]
-----
controller.schedule(operation)
-----
* The client is shielded from changes to anything except the ```controller```
* Responsibility for making it work is delegated to the appropriate class
* Need to be careful not to reduce the cohesion by creating a too-broad API


=== Redundancy
* One place for every concept

image:alarm_ringing-512.png[width=30]

* Watch out for
** Copy-and-paste reuse

=== Clarity
* Good naming
* Command / query separation
* Obviousness

image:alarm_ringing-512.png[width=30]

* Watch out for
** Long methods & classes
** Short variable names
** Deep nesting

=== Clarity :(
[source,java]
-----
public void getSettings() {
  this.settings.clear();
  this.settings.reload("/etc/defaults/settings.conf")
}
-----
* Surprising behaviour
** ```get``` is a query (not a command)
*** it *should* return a value
*** it *should not* change state

=== Clarity :)
[source,java]
-----
public void reloadSettings() {
  this.settings.clear();
  this.settings.reload("/etc/defaults/settings.conf")
}

public String getSetting(String key) { ... }
-----
* The method names explain their intention
** ```reload``` is a command


== Clean Code and Refactoring

image:refactoring-book.jpeg[width=350]

1999

=== What is Refactoring
[%step]
_noun_: a change made to the internal structure of software +
to make it *easier to understand* and *cheaper to modify* +
without changing its *observable behavior*


_verb_: to restructure software by applying a series of
refactorings without changing its observable behavior


=== What is Refactoring
[%step]
"a disciplined technique for *restructuring* an existing +
body of code, altering its *internal structure* without +
changing its *external behavior*.

Its heart is a series of *small* behavior preserving +
transformations. Each transformation ... +
does little, but a *sequence* of transformations can produce +
a *significant restructuring*."

=== Code 'Smells'

Hints that something _may_ be wrong with the design

* The book has a table of 'smells' linked to suggested refactoring steps

=== Simple structural problems
* Long Method/Class
* Duplicated Code
* Conditional Complexity
* Dead Code

=== Inheritance & Encapsulation
* Refused Bequest
** Inherited methods that aren't used
* Inappropriate Intimacy
** Classes should know as little as possible about each other.
* Indecent Exposure
** refactor classes to minimize their public surface
* Feature Envy
** Methods that make extensive use of another class may belong in another class.

=== A Similar Message
* Prefer low coupling, high cohesion, small, simple, well encapsulated code.
* SONAR reports most of these too

=== Refactorings

http://refactoring.com/catalog/

=== Structural Fixes

* Extract Method
* Extract Variable
* Extract Interface
* Pull-up/Push-down
* Renames

* The IDE will do these for you (safely)

=== Example: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism :(

[source]
-----
double getSpeed() {
  switch (_type) {
    case EUROPEAN:
      return getBaseSpeed();
    case AFRICAN:
      return getBaseSpeed() - getLoadFactor() * _numberOfCoconuts;
    case NORWEGIAN_BLUE:
      return (_isNailed) ? 0 : getBaseSpeed(_voltage);
  }
  throw new RuntimeException ("Should be unreachable");
}
-----
* Adding a new ```_type``` means another ```case``` block
* Re-using logic is error-prone or impossible
* Similar conditional logic for other operations

=== Example: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism :)
image:class-diagram-polymorphism.jpeg[]

* Adding a new type means adding a new class (the rest of the code may be unchanged)
* Reuse logic through inheritance or composition as appropriate

== Design Patterns

image:design-patterns-book.jpeg[width=350]

1994

=== Design Patterns
[%step]
_"a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design."_

* A common vocabulary
* A destination for a refactoring
* Rough templates, adapt them to the specific situation
* Trade-off of added complexity

=== Creational

* Factories
** Encapsulate the knowledge of how to build different variations of a type
* Builders
** Encapsulate how to assemble families of related objects
* Singleton
** Manage the lifecycle of expensive or scarce resources
** Doesn't need to be global shared state

=== Structural
* Adaptor
** Translate between different protocols (encapsulate the differences)
* Facade
** Hide a complex API behind a simpler one
* Decorator
** Wrap one object in another of the same type and add behaviour
** Java IO libraries
* Composite
** Homogeneous tree structures e.g. Files/Directories

=== Behavioural
* State
** Encapsulate differences in behaviour into objects
** Common refactoring for big conditional blocks
** Runtime re-composition
* Strategy
** Encapsulate different algorithms
* Iterator
** Encapsulate how to traverse a structure
** Built in to most languages

== Closing Thoughts
[%step]
* Clean code is about making our jobs as programmers *easier*
* There are *simple criteria* we can apply to the code we write to help us judge how *maintainable* it is
* Code evolves as features are added and requirements become clear, *constant refactoring* helps keep our code clean
* The problems we try to solve are both new and old at the same time, *design patterns* help to guide the design

== Checklist

* *Size* - _small classes (=< 500 LoC), methods (=< 20 LoC)_
* *Encapsulation* - _minimum public 'surface', hide implementation details, don't share data, expose operations_
* *Cohesion* - _one major responsibility_
* *Coupling* - _low dependency count, no temporal coupling (e.g. ```Thread.sleep()```), inheritance is for 'is-a' relationships_
* *Redundancy* - _no copy-and-paste, one place to update each concept_
* *Clarity* - _good names, no surprises, obvious, short_
